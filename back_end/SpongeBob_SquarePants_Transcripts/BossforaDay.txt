[This episode starts at the Krusty Krab when Mr. Krabs is trying to sort out some chaos.]
Mr. Krabs: Where's that order for table 3? Table 5 ready to be bust. There's a spill in the bathroom! I need you swabbing the deck, Mr. Squidward! [His eyes act like periscopes and then notices something.] SpongeBob! Table 8 needs more coral fries! Hop to it boy!
SpongeBob: [Gasping] I'm hopping sir.
Incidental 13: My thirst is not yet quenched. [moaning]
Mr. Krabs: Ha, tiyah, here you go, thank you. No free refills. [laughs]
Incidental 42: [grunts] I'm out of ketchup!
Incidental 93: We need utensils!
Incidental 114: [car horn honks] I ordered this to go!
Mr. Krabs: Yep [showing his claw] takes a pretty steady claw to oversee this ship [his claw barks and smells like a dog] what is it, girl? What do you smell? [Mr. Krabs finds a penny on the floor] Ooh. Find a penny. Pick it up. All day long you'll have a penny! [laughs, then scrubs his claws] What a good girl! [laughs]
SpongeBob: [opens the door directly into Mr. Krabs' butt] Order up!
[Mr. Krabs falls into a customer, breaks the table, smashes things into a pole, knocks down the "Krusty Krab" sign, falls in the road, and a penny falls onto the road]
Worker fish: Hey, a penny!
[A piano falls into Mr. Krabs, and the ambulance arrives]
SpongeBob: [he is seen panicking] Somebody call an ambulance! [he stops panicking] Oh, you're here.
[Squidward walks outside]
SpongeBob: Wait, Mr. Krabs. Who's in charge while you're out?
[Mr. Krabs wakes up, he chooses between SpongeBob and Squidward. He's about to point to Squidward, when Squidward holds up SpongeBob, so he's really choosing SpongeBob with his mouth as piano keys]
[Mr. Krabs' claw is broken] Not SpongeBob.
Incidental 25: Let's go.
Mr, Krabs: No! No!
SpongeBob: Oh, he picked me. I'm in charge!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, Mr. Krabs. I'll be the best boss that Krusty Krab ever had.
SpongeBob: Just like you Mr. Krabs!
Squidward: Ha, you can't do Mr. Krabs' job.
SpongeBob: [cries] I can't?
Squidward: Course not. You're gonna get some annoying idea in your head, act all silly and ruin everything. [starts walking away] Like you always do.
SpongeBob: (thinking) I guess if I want to become a boss like Mr. Krabs... [looks like Mr. Krabs] ...then I'll learn to think like Mr. Krabs. [laughs like Mr. Krabs]
[Incidental 49 takes Krabs to the Krusty Krab in a wheelchair]
SpongeBob: (opens the door, and Incidental 49 appears in a slight shock of what SpongeBob did to Krabs) Mr. Krabs, I'm so glad you're back! [smiles and then Mr. Krabs shakes]
SpongeBob: [pushes his wheelchair back up]
Mr. Krabs: Woh!
SpongeBob: Just wait til you see what I've done to your restaurant. [pulling the wheelchair and headed to the Krusty Krab and looks around him and his customers]
SpongeBob: Nothing. Is it great? Everything's just how you left it. Whenever we have a problem around here, I ask myself what would Mr. Krabs do.
SpongeBob: [turns Mr. Krabs' wheelchair and makes Mr. Krabs dizzy] And I do that!
SpongeBob: I even hired a new fry cook since I'm too busy being the boss now.
[SpongeBob turned Mr. Krabs' wheelchair to see the new fry cook]
SpongeBob: Just like you would have done.
[Mr. Krabs makes weird angry sounds and Patrick wearing SpongeBob's pants and spatula is in his bellybutton and put it back and he tried to eat a patty]
SpongeBob: Don't worry, I taught him everything I know. [turns Mr. Krabs' wheelchair and makes Mr. Krabs dizzy again]
[Patrick puts the spatula in his mouth and he grabs the ketchup and puts the spatula back in his hand and the spatula is drooling and he flipped the ketchup with the spatula and put it on the grill and the grill is burning and the ketchup is about to explode, and Squidward reading his book and his face, part of his book and the window is covered with ketchup ]
Patrick: Order Up!
[Squidward gets very angry]
SpongeBob: You'll have a better view of my managerial magic from over here. [turns Mr. Krabs' wheelchair and makes Mr. Krabs dizzy again]
Incidental 69: I'm out of napkins.
SpongeBob: Ooo, here we go. Watch me work! Your napkins, sir.
Incidental 69: Thank you.
Incidental 23: [the baby is jumping down the table] Hey! This table is too wobbly.
SpongeBob: [duct tape in hand] I'll let the boss take care of that.
[The table is not wobbly and the baby is duct-taped and making weird sounds]
Incidental 42: Hm.
Squidward: What do you want?
SpongeBob: [gasps] Squidward, what would Mr. Krabs say?
SpongeBob: [looking like Mr. Krabs]At the Krusty Krab, Mr. Squidward. We're always polite to our payin' customers.
Squidward: Welcome to the Krusty Krab. May I please take your order?
SpongeBob: Remember, Squidward. Service with a smile. Here. Try one of Mr. Krab's vintage training devices. [puts Squidward's head in the training device]
Squidward: [freaky smile] May I please take your order?
Incidental 42: Oh, uh. I'll take a Krabby patty [chuckles]. Hold the freaky smile.
SpongeBob: I think that went pretty well, don't you?
Squidward: [yells] SpongeBob! You aggravating, obnoxious, loathsome little...
[Squidward and SpongeBob heard a loud noise]
SpongeBob: Oh, hold that constructive criticism, Squidward. I'll be right back.
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing?
Patrick: I'm cleaning the deli slicer. I used the tongs like you said.
SpongeBob: [Looks like Mr. Krabs] Ah, Ah, Ah. The tongs are for holding rags not bricks.
SpongeBob: Let me finish this pal. You get back on the grill.
Patrick: Okeydoke. [gets back on the grill and he throws a brick at the deli slicer, and the brick directly to the window to Mr. Krab's face and gets dizzy]
[The next scene is Patrick is at his grill]
[Patrick is smashing his spatula]
SpongeBob: Hey, um, Patrick? Could you, er... bump the grill temperature up about half a degree?
Patrick: Fine.
[Patrick is flipping the patties counterclockwise with his spatula]
SpongeBob: [tapping his finger to Patrick] And you should be flipping the patties with the clockwise wrist motion because [looking like Mr. Krabs] the customer can always taste the difference.
Patrick: Whatever you say, boss. Oh, dirty.
[Patrick is smashing the patties with his spatula and puts the Krabby Patty in the wrong order]
SpongeBob: [gasps] No, Patrick! We went over this! It goes bun, patty, cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, bun, not bun, patty, cheese, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, bun.
Patrick: That's it! This was supposed to be fun, but now it's...er... the other thing! I quit! [he eats his Krabby Patty, and before he walks out, he rips his pants and throws his pants]
Patrick: These too!
SpongeBob: But, Patrick, you are my best friend-mployee.
SpongeBob: [walking to the door and spins vertically and his eyes, nose, and mouth disappear] Woah!
SpongeBob: [falls down to the ground and the second SpongeBob's eyes, nose, mouth, and pants appeared] Spoink!
SpongeBob: Wow! Aren't you a real slice off the ol' block?
SpongeBob: [grabs his spatula, and the other SpongeBob is surprised] Can you work the grill?
SpongeBob: [grabs his spatula and takeover his job, and laughs] Mm-hmm. Ha! You're hired! [grabs his spatula and points to his body and walking to the door]
SpongeBob: [his face blows up and down] Ah...
[The angry mob talks angrily to Squidward]
Squidward: [walking out the Krusty Krab with an angry face]
SpongeBob: [talking like Mr. Krabs and looking like him] Mr. Squidward, it's not time for your break.
Squidward: I'm taking a permanent break, from you! I quit! [walks out the Krusty Krab with an angry face]
SpongeBob: No! [angry mob walking to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Uh, oh. I need more employees.
SpongeBob: [pointing his finger] Ooh... Uh, just a second, everybody! [grabs a thing and spoink himself and make a paper airplane to the cashier]
SpongeBob: How can I help you?
[The customers come and order something]
SpongeBob: Woo! Everything is under control now, Mr. K.
SpongeBob: I guarantee it.
Incidental 45: Oh, dear. Oops, I spilled...
Incidental 60: Whoa! [trips and falls]
Incidental 60: [water on his head and Krabby Patty on his legs] Oops, I fell down.
SpongeBob: No!
Incidental 64: [pointing to the TV] Hey! How come the TV don't work?
SpongeBob: Oh, no!
Incidental 40: [waving his hand like a fan and he's sweating] It's too hot in here..
[SpongeBob starts worrying]
Incidental 41: [freezing] It's too cold in here.
SpongeBob: [looking around] What do I do? What do I do?
Mr. Krabs: [feels angry and going up and down]
SpongeBob: [waving his hands and screaming] Everybody stop!
SpongeBob: [goes into the kitchen, spoik with a shovel thrice, puts himself thrice in a drawer and goes to the deli slicer, blows his hands, and goes into the deli slicer, copying himself eleven times, helps the customers, and tries to make Mr. Krabs dizzy]
Patrick: Don't mind me. I'm just here to clean out my desk. [cleaning out and walking out in the nude]
SpongeBob: [dancing and then blowing copies of SpongeBob] No! My slices!
Incidental 60: [water on his head and Krabby Patty on his legs again]
SpongeBob: Stop, please! You're ruining the Krusty Krab dining experience.
SpongeBob: [his copies then hit the fan. The copies get shredded, fall on the floor and the customers get hit as well and then the customers run out of the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: [makes weird angry sounds again, and this makes his bandage suit unwrap and the shredded copies of SpongeBob go away]
SpongeBob: [off-screen] Mr. Krabs! You're all better! [SpongeBob's body gets revealed] Sorry I let you down. [pleads] All I wanted was to be a good boss. Just like you.
Mr. Krabs: Oh well, there is no need to get your sails in a twist about it boy. Nobody's just like me, especially you. Besides, you saved me months in that there body cast. If it weren't for the rage I felt watching you destroy me restaurant, I woulda never forced me body to heal so quickly!
SpongeBob: Oh, so in a way, I’ve done good, huh?
Mr. Krabs: Oh no! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not even close. You were the worst boss ever! I’m gonna have to dock your pay for decades, just to cover all the damage you caused! [laughs and turns on fan as he walks away]
SpongeBob: Oh, thanks Mr. Krabs! [spins along with the fan] You're the best boss ever!
