[The episode starts in a flea circus, where a flea is riding a unicycle on a tightrope. He falls off his unicycle and lands onto a net. Another flea gets shot from a cannon, and grabs onto a swing.]
Announcer: See them soar! See them juggle! And so much more! It's Circus Sea Fleas! And they were born to please you!
