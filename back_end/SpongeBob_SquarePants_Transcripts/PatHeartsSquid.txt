[A crablike creature is walking along the ground, and a giant mud monster arises from the ground and scares it away.]
Squidward: Be quiet down there or I'm calling the cops!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [break out of the mud monster] What?!
Squidward: [sighs] I said... [screaming loudly] be quiet, [puts his head out the window] or I'm calling the [he loses balance, and he falls along with his entire house. The house then crumbles into pieces.] My house! My shelter! My life!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [putting their hands on Squidward's shoulders] My my my... [Squidward releases their arms]
SpongeBob: So, who you gonna stay with until you find a new house, Squidward? Me, or Patrick?
Squidward: I wouldn't stay with either of you two idiots if the entire ocean was on fire and you were the only ones with water.
Patrick: So there's a chance!
Squidward: [frustrated, he pretends to open the nonexistent door to his house and slams it, making him fall to the ground]
[bubble transitions to a shot of Conch Street, where Squidward's house is now a tent. Squidward gargles in his mouth while in a sleeping bag and spits into a bucket.]
Squidward: Ah, roughin' it ain't so rough. [he turns off a lantern and goes to sleep]
The wind carries the tent into the air along with Squidward's nightcap, and he wakes up. It then starts raining.
Squidward: Too rough! [he flips a coin] Oh... I guess it's Patrick. [he zips himself up into the sleeping bag and inches towards Patrick's rock.]
French Narrator: Zee next morning...
Patrick: [talks like Squidward] Well, Patrick, time for another lovely day in the flower garden of life. [gets up, and notices that his home is now a mess]
Squidward: [resembles Patrick and holds a brick] I love you brick! [smashes his head into the brick] I love you brick! [smashes his head into the brick again] I love you brick! [smashes his head into the brick for a third time]
Patrick: [takes the brick off Squidward's face] Squidward, you kelp head, what did you do to my beautiful house?!
Squidward: Define do. [shoves a Squidward-like Patrick figurine up his nose]
Patrick: [screams] [takes the figurine off Squidward's nose, revealing Squidward's brain on top] Don't put my art up your nose, you cretin!
Squidward: [takes back his brain on top of the figurine with his tongue and eats it] I might need that someday. Duh!
Patrick: Ugh... [he puts the figurine on a sand table] I'll play the old licorice stick. That always soothes my nerves. [he opens a clarinet case to see that his clarinet is missing, and gasps]
Squidward: [eats the clarinet] Doesn't taste like licorice.
Patrick: My clarinet! Noo!
Squidward: [spits out clarinet bits] Oh, sorry. You want some?
Patrick: [slaps the clarinet bits out of Squidward's hand with a wooden spoon] Ah-ah-ah. The etiquette spoon came back and he says, 'Eat like a gentleman.'
Squidward: Umm...ummm...I 'm going to go play with my best friend SpongeBob. [laughs like Patrick and runs out]
Patrick: [off-screen] Goodnight, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Goodnight, Patrick.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Goodnight, Squidward. [They kiss Squidward, and Squidward begins sobbing uncontrollably, and then claps his hands twice to turn off the lights, ending the episode]
