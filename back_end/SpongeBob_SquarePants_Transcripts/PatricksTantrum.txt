[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab with the kitchen's bell ringing]
SpongeBob: [he serves a Krabby Patty] Okay, okay, order up. [he notices that the bell is still ringing.] Uh, hello, Krusty kitchen- Hmm? [the bell is still ringing near his direction. His eyes go thru the telephone, then go to the fireplace] Hello? It sounds like... sleigh bells! [his body goes into the fireplace.] Is that you, Santa Claus? [he then his head gets splatted with blue ink.] I can still hear the rin...go. [He randomly pops an ear out from his body as his two eyes go in them.] Hmm. No bells in here. Uh, this is serious. [He then runs to the front door, as Mr. Krabs is seen.]
Mr. Krabs: [whistling and grabs SpongeBob.] And just where do you think you're going during business hours?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Mr. Krabs, but I got to see an ear doctor. I've been hearing a ringing in my ears all week.
Mr. Krabs: Hold your seahorses, boy-o. You don't have tinnit-er-s.
SpongeBob: I don't?
Mr. Krabs: No. [gets a small bell] I've been ringing this bell all week, and don't it condition the customers? Whenever they hear the bell. [rings the bell] They'll hunger for a Krabby Patty, and come straight to the Krusty Krab.
SpongeBob: Oh. I don't get it.
Mr. Krabs: Observe. First, I'll condition them while there're eating.
[Mr Krabs rings bell in front of Incidental 7, who is eating a Krabby Patty.]
Incidental 7: Beat it, quasimdodo.
[Mr Krabs rings bell in front of another family at the Krusty Krab.]
Blue fish: I'm gonna go bop that guy.
Brown fish: No no, hon. Think of the children.
Blue fish: Oh, you're right, dear. Kids, go bop that guy.
[The two kids jump up and attack Mr. Krabs, but Mr. Krabs moves away from them. He walks up to Tom.
Tom: [burps]
Mr. Krabs: Now this guy's heard the bell before. Watch him when he hears it.
[Mr. Krabs rings the bell in front of Tom. His brain turns into the shape of a Krabby Patty in response.]
Tom: [starts drolling all over the table] I want another Krabby Patty. [notices he's drooling] And a bucket for my saliva.
SpongeBob: [jumps around] Ooh. Can I ring the little bell? Can I? Can I? Can I?
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you can do better than that, boy-o. You can ring the big bell.
[Mr. Krabs stomps on the ground, revealing a rope.]
SpongeBob: Oh! [He tries pulling on the rope, but it is too heavy. Mr. Krabs gives him an assist and he starts ringing the bell. The bell sound spreads to all of Bikini Bottom.]
Incidental 118D: [directs traffic and starts drooling] Krabby patties!
[Her neglect causes several cars to crash into each other. Thy all fall victim to the bell and start drooling.The scene then cuts to three doctors performing surgery. They also fall victim to the bell]
Incidental 41: [zips up stomach and starts drooling] Krabby patties!
Crowd: [walks towards the Krusty Krab] Krabby patties! Krabby patties![The crowd then apears eating Krabby Patties inside.
Patrick: [bursts through glass doors] No! Nooooo! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! [he throws a tantrum on the Krusty Krab floors, causing the customers to leave]
Incidental 37b: [runs inside of and hits large bell]
Patrick: [continues to throw tantrum]
Mr. Krabs: What the halibut is wrong with you, boy?
[Patrick uses his legs to throw Mr. Krabs onto Squidward and continues to throw tantrum]
Mr. Krabs: [emerges from Squidward's station] He's lost his mind!
Squidward: He never had a mind.
SpongeBob: Oh, I've seen this before. I know what to do![jumps through order window and jumps onto a wailing Patrick, rubbing jellyfish jelly on him as well. This causes Patrick to calm down.] When Patrick has a tantrum like this, jellyfish jelly on the belly is the only thing that calms him down. Then when he comes out of it, he hardly remembers a thing!
Patrick: [stands up and calms down]
SpongeBob: Hey buddy, feel better? What's the last thing you remember?
Patrick: Uh, I remember hearing a bell ring. [flashback to when Patrick was a kid] When I was a little sea star, and it was time for my bath, my parents would always ring a bell.
Herb Star: Time for your bath, son!
Patrick: [narrating] I didn't want a bath. [flashback Patrick starts wailing and flashback ends] After that, the only thing I remember is nothing.
SpongeBob: Then it's time for me to be proactive and help my buddy here. I am going to silence every ding dong bell in town. Starting with... [He rushes over the counter and smashes the ordering bell on the window] Yaa. This one. [SpongeBob then pulls the rope very hard making the large bell fall on the ground breaking it in half] And this one.
Mr. Krabs: Wait. How'd you get so strong all of a sudden?
SpongeBob: [dressed as a superhero] Through the power of friendship! [Patrick applauds him] Look out bells of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob is about to silence every ring, chime, buzz, and jingle jangle! [He leaps into the air smashing through the Krusty Krab's roof and flies off]
Patrick: (teary eyed) There goes that dear darling dude
Mr. Krabs: (sadly) There goes my brilliant bell business. (to Patrick) You know Pato. I was studying your impressive moves during your little... (pauses for a moment) Acrimony.
Patrick: My little macaroni?
Mr. Krabs: Yeah that's right. And I believe that I have a way to make back all the money I'm gonna lose. (He holds up a poster of Harry the Health Hazard) One million dollars to the challenger that can beat Harry the Health Hazard in Supreme Fighting
Patrick: [laughs and proceeds to take a bite of the poster then claps]
