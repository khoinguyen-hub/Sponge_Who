[The episode begins with SpongeBob talking to Gary in his library.]
SpongeBob: Are you ready for a bedtime story, Gary?
Gary: [goes into his shell and pops out wearing a night hat and yawns] Meow, meow.
SpongeBob: [twists around his chair and starts wearing a fancy outfit] Good evening, Gary, and welcome to Pat-Star-Piece Theatre. [sips his pipe while bubbles come out of it]
Patrick: [Patrick is shown on a high wheel bicycle drinking tea in front of a red stage with Pat-Star-Piece Theatre written in red. There are two trumpets blowing as well.] Hot, hot, hot! [Patrick falls off the bicycle.]
SpongeBob: [pulling his mustache] Hmm. [picks out a book] Would you like to hear an exciting story about Great Sir Patrick and the Fire-Breathing Dragon? [he opens the book and gets burned by the contents inside.]
Gary: [scared] Meow. [shaking his head] Meow.
SpongeBob: [closes the book, cleans his face and puts the book back on the shelf] Or perhaps a thrilling tale of explorer Patrick on safari in the jungle! [a lion head comes out of the book and roars at SpongeBob, scaring him while Gary hides in his shell. Once he closes it, SpongeBob pants heavily]
Gary: Meow, meow.
SpongeBob: [puts the book inside a cage] Ah! [he picks out a book called "Swamp Mates." He blows on the dust and goes to his chair] This is a good one. "Swamp Mates," a story of two buffoons in a bog. [he and Gary laugh. SpongeBob opens the book, disgusted by the amount of bugs there are on it] Gee. Once upon a time, there was a saucy superhero with a prognathous posterior, and they called him [SpongeBob turns the page where Bubble Bass is shown] Bubble Bass.
[the scene changes to the First Nautical Bank, with Man Ray running outside with a loot of cash]
Bank guard: [points to Man Ray] Stop, thief!
[Bubble Bass is seen in his plane targeting Man Ray and obtaining his information. He hits the eject button and goes in mid-air. He smashes his posterior onto Man Ray, and at that moment the Anchor Man pauses the video.]
Anchor Man: Excellent job capturing Man Ray last week, Bubble Bass!
Bubble Bass: Thank you, Anchor Man, [he sits up] he was no match for my [shows his posterior to the crew, with dumbbells on them] mighty heinie! [starts lifting the dumbbells with his posterior, while Anchor Man and the others look with interest. After finishing, he clears his throat] I call this meeting of the Guild of Obsessive Fans, aka G.O.O.F.S [shows his G.O.O.F.S uniform] to order, fellow heroes! Let us welcome our newest member, Wonder Whale! [her chair is shown to be empty. Suburban Dad looks concerned about this. Bubble Bass clicks his mouth and looks at his watch] It would appear Wonder Whale is late.
The Chief: [The Chief appears on the screen after a ringing sound occurs] Heroes!
Anchor Man: [he salutes] It's the chief!
The Chief: Wonder Whale isn't late, she's been kidnapped! By the avarice snare dwell, Hoodoo Guru, the voodoo villain!
[The heroes start gasping in disbelief. An anchor drops on Anchor Man's foot, then Bubble Bass shows his abs]
Bubble Bass: Don't worry Chief! We'll rescue Wonder Wha-
Mama Bass: [knocks on his door, revealing this whole sequence just to be an imagination] Bubble Bass?!
Bubble Bass: Mother?! [His stomach fat slaps on the table]
The Chief: [screams] Your mother! [gets his hand out of the screen to turn it off, then disappearing into static]
Bubble Bass: [grunts and groans as his fantasy is interrupted as he is in his mother's basement]
Mama Bass: [from across the room] Why don't you go outside and make some real friends?
Bubble Bass: Mother, you know direct sunlight gives me gas. [burps loudly] Besides, I'm busy looking for my Wonder Whale... [looks under the couch] action figure.
Mama Bass: I knew you'd say something like that.
Bubble Bass: [angered] Why you...
Mama Bass: So your mother has scheduled a playdate for you.
Bubble Bass: I'm not 23 anymore, mother! You'll just have to cancel it!
Mama Bass: Too late, your new friend is already here. Have fun!
Bubble Bass: [walks up the stairs and hears knocking, then opening the door to reveal Patrick at the entrance] Huh?!
Patrick: Hey buddy! Ready for our playdate? [squeezes Bubble Bass into a tight hug]
Bubble Bass: [slaps Patrick and picks him up to scold him] I will not associate with such a dimwitted doofus.
Patrick: [flattered] Aw, you're just saying that!
Bubble Bass: [angered by his stupidity] Ugh! [Throws Patrick back outside of the room and slams the door on him, create a dent in the shape of his body through the door] Ugh! [gasps to see Patrick somehow found his way into the basement despite being thrown out with the door being closed] What?!
Patrick: [laughing as he is playing with his Man Ray and Anchor Man action figures, then chews on the Man Ray one]
Bubble Bass: [snatches the figurine out of his hand] Put those down! [Takes the rest of the action figures on the table and hugs them in protection] My poor things. But don't worry, daddy will protect you.
Patrick: [starts chewing on the Anchor Man figure]
Bubble Bass: [snatches the figure out of his mouth] You've completely chewed up my limited-edition Anchor Man! [A close-up is shown of the action figure in a chewed stated covered with saliva. Bubble Bass then groans]
Patrick: Sorry! I'm teething. [A close-up is shown of Patrick's one tooth and his deteriorated gums pounding]
Bubble Bass: [groans as his head start to release smoke due to anger]
Patrick: So... What do you want to do for our playdate? [Wraps his arm around Bubble Bass' neck]
Bubble Bass: [pushes Patrick aside] I have no time for a cretin like you. I must find my Wonder Whale action figure. [Walks off to find it]
Patrick: [gets excited and starts making an amused face] Oh? Oh! I'll help you look! [Lifts a box upside down filled with other toys and skims through the pile, then throwing some of the toys at the wall]
Bubble Bass: Stop it you clod! [Walks over to confront him] Do not touch any of my property!
Patrick: Oh! That's okay! We can play with my game. [Takes out a gigantic bag from his pants and jumps onto it, which leaks out green liquid] Let's play swamp! [Opens up the bag to reveal more of the green liquid, which he then pours on the ground as it floods the basement]
Bubble Bass: [gasps and becomes repulsed] Wait, stop! What are you doing?! [Screams as Patrick creates a flooding. The action figures get lost in the flooding, but Bubble Bass manages to catch some of them] No! My precious babies!
Patrick: Hehe, no problem! I'll fix it! [Flushes the toilet but it causes the swamp liquid to flush down]
Bubble Bass: [notices his Wonder Whale action figure in the swamp liquid] My Wonder Whale! [Runs to catch it before it is too late]
Patrick: I got it! [Tries to catch it but misses. Hangs onto the toilet so he does not get sucked into the liquid, where the toy is heading]
Bubble Bass: [hangs onto the back of Patrick's short as Patrick hangs onto the toilet seat, which then detaches as both of them get sucked into the drain and find themselves in a swamp forest. After the screen turns to black, Bubble Bass is shown sticking his head out from the swamp pool with the toilet seat around his neck] Wonder Whale! Where are you? [Is about to drown into the liquid] I. Require. Assistance! [Sinks into the swamp pool]
Patrick: I got you, playdate partner! [Grabs Bubble Bass by the head to save him from drowning. Patrick then starts to lose balance and slips continuously on the log, causing Bubble Bass to spin in circles]
Bubble Bass: [coughs up liquid as he slowly regains consciousness] Where am I? [Becomes nervous as he hears an owl howling and looks around] By the enchanted spatula of Suburban Dad... We're in a real swamp! [Notices the toilet seat around his neck] Ew! Why am I wearing this collar of shame?!
Patrick: I think it looks good on you.
Bubble Bass: [removes the toilet seat from his neck and throws it into the lake] Eugh! I despise nature.
Patrick: Aww you just haven't given it a chance. Smell that swamp air! [Patrick inhales deeply and gets a lot of plants and a few firefly-like jellyfish stuck inside his nose, then sneezes them out as the firejellies fly into Bubble Bass' mouth and sting him constantly before flying out and giving him a tongue blister]
Bubble Bass: [looks at his stung tongue] My tongue! [Notices Patrick drinking a cup of what seems to be water] Water! Give me water! [Takes Patrick's cup and drinks it, but then spits it out in disgust over realizing it is not water, but rather the swamp goo] Ew! Where did you get this disgusting liquid?!
Patrick: [drags his cup through the swamp goo and turns its upside down as the solid liquid gets into his mouth. He then swallows the goo] Ah. Slimy and refreshing.
Bubble Bass: This can't be happening. [Preaches out loud] This place is a nightmare! [Sobs] I'll never find my Wonder Whale action figure. [They then hear an evil guy laughing and see his shadow behind one of the plants. Both Bubble Bass and Patrick gasp] What is that? [The guy is then revealed to have stolen Bubble Bass' Wonder Whale action figure] My Wonder Whale! That crook stole my precious possession! [Points his finger at him] Get him!
Patrick: Are we playing tag? I love tag! [Jumps off the log and onto the sand with Bubble Bass. Puts his dirt-covered hand on Bubble Bass' face] Tag you're it! Hahaha! [The man then takes off with Bubble Bass' action figure]
Bubble Bass: After him! [He and Patrick run to chase the villain. Patrick trips over some rocks and lands his face into Bubble Bass' butt]
Patrick: Where'd he go?
Bubble Bass: Perhaps he's in that dilapidated dwelling. [points to an old shack house]
Patrick: Doubt it. Maybe he's in that shack? [Points to it. Bubble Bass is angered by his stupidity. They then look through the window of the shack to reveal a blue and green alligator, the blue one pouring peppers into a machine]
Bubble Bass: Hmph. It's just some uncouth natives. [Both he and Patrick get grabbed by the heads by a purple alligator]
Patrick: Hello! [He and Bubble Bass then get thrown into the shack]
Buford: I caught these two a peepin' through the window.
Cletus: They're thieves! Trying to steal our illegal hot sauce.
Bubble Bass: Illegal?
Luther: Our swamp sauce is so spicy, it can blow your head clean off.
Bubble Bass: I assure you we are not interested in your disgusting hot sauce.
Cletus: Then what's he doing?
Patrick: [gulps the bucket of hot sauce, and his head explodes from his body and makes a steam sound, and his head falls into Bubble Bass' arms] Huh. You call that spicy? [burps out flames, causing the nearby equipment to catch on fire]
Bubble Bass: [aiming Patrick's head at the alligators] Back off, you backwater bumpkins! Run!
Cletus: After 'em, boys! You ain't a-gettin' away that easy!
Luther: Yee-ha.
Bubble Bass: Ha, too slow, you cold-blooded clowns. Those Crocs are catching up with us!
Patrick: That hot sauce has already caught up with me.
Bubble Bass: That's it!
Cletus: What?!
Bubble Bass: So, play date partner. What are we supposed to do now? Hmm?
Bubble Bass: Give me back my Wonder Whale!
Hoodoo Guru: Huh?
Patrick: Huh? Hey, wait for me, buddy!
Bubble Bass: Come back here. You'll swing for this, you ruffian!
Hoodoo Guru: I am afraid you are the ones who will swing. You ignoramuses fell right into my trap!
Patrick: Technically, I'm a doofus.
Bubble Bass: Hoodoo Guru the Voodoo Villain? He's real!
Hoodoo Guru: That's right, Bubble Bass, and your precious Wonder Whale is all mine.
Bubble Bass: I dread to think what horrific ritual you will use it for.
Hoodoo Guru: Huh? Ritual, shmitual! I just needed it to complete my collection.
Bubble Bass: Stealing from a fellow collector? That's despicable! I will thrash you, sir! Can't break out.
Patrick: You're probably weak from hunger. Here, try some of this spaghetti.
Bubble Bass: Mmm! Glorious caloric intake! Wherever did you find it?
Patrick: We're sitting on it!
Hoodoo Guru: Ouch.
Bubble Bass: Ha ha! Evil never triumphs against a truly obsessive fan!
Patrick: Yeah! Evil never triumphs over a oscillating fan!
Hoodoo Guru: Not so fast, Bubble Bass. I've got one more trick up my sleeve. Or should I say, up my glove!
Bubble Bass: A Patrick Star action figure? Ha! No collector would touch such trash.
Patrick: Plus, it's a choking hazard. What's going on?
Bubble Bass: That fiend, Hoodoo, is using his magic voodoo doll powers.
Patrick: Sorry.
Hoodoo Guru: I'll take that.
Bubble Bass: Stop! I'm allergic to centrifugal force!
Hoodoo Guru: Uh-oh.
Bubble Bass: Ha! I'll return this to its rightful owner. Me.
Patrick: Well done, pal.
Bubble Bass: Eww.
Buford: Hey, Luther, Cletus, I found them fellers what blowed up our still!
Patrick: Oh, hi!
Bubble Bass: No, our only escape! If only I had something large and buoyant.
Patrick: I don't know what that means, but... Hop on, friend!
Bubble Bass: Friend?
Patrick: Sure, you're my play date, right, buddy?
Bubble Bass: Buddy?
Hoodoo Guru: It's over, Bubble Bass! Give up!
Bubble Bass: You will never win, Hoodoo, because we have the power of reluctant friendship! Yeah, that's right. Run away from our righteous acquaintance!
Patrick: Uh, they might be running from that.
Bubble Bass: What happened?
Patrick: Oh, you were dead for like 10 minutes.
Bubble Bass: Oh, it was all just a hallucination? Then my Wonder Whale action figure is still missing.
Patrick: Well, you may have lost your toy, but you've gained an indoor pool! Congratulations!
Bubble Bass: My precious Wonder Whale!
Mama Bass: Bubble Bass! What did you do to my basement?
Bubble Bass: Perhaps the swamp wasn't so bad after all.
The Chief: Whoo-hoo! This completes my collection.
