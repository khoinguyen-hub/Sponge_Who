[The episode begins with a speakerphone shown up close.]
Man on speaker: What beautiful day for a ball game, eh, sports fans? [a butterfly flies to the speaker] Play ball! [the butterfly flies after the speaker was very loud] Here's the pitch! [A robotic arm is shown with a baseball. The arm throws the ball. The camera turns around, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick. They were on a ride of Glove World! An invisible person with gloves swings the bat and hits the ball which sends SpongeBob and Patrick off.] They're going, they're going!
SpongeBob and Patrick: We're gone!
[SpongeBob and Patrick are pressed into the seats as the ride accelerates. The ball lands on a glove and an animatronic coach comes to the scene.]
Animatronic Coach: You're outta there!
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit out of the baseball and leave the ride. The scene cuts to outside the ride, which is called "Catch Me!" as SpongeBob and Patrick exit the ride.]
SpongeBob: Boy, do I love the two-fisted fun at Glove World! [laughs]
Patrick: [hands out a fist on a stick] And the Ham Fists aren't bad either! [starts chewing on it]
SpongeBob: Wow, that ride was so fun! I could do it a million, zillion, jillion, dillion, cotillion times! [breaths]
Patrick: [nudges SpongeBob with his elbow] I got you covered!
[Patrick squeezes out a bunch of tickets out of his belly button and they pile up on him and SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh, yeah!
[They run back inside the ride with the tickets around them.]
French Narrator: One million, zillion, jillion, dillion, cotillion times later...
[SpongeBob and Patrick are shown on the Catch Me! ride again. The animatronic coach appears again as the ride ends.]
Animatronic Coach: You're outta there! Eh, whatever.
[SpongeBob and Patrick exit the ride with their faces frozen after riding it a lot of times. They walk up to a woman. Her baby screams in terror at SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Woman Fish: Oh, my baby! [runs away]
SpongeBob: [face frozen] Patrick?
Patrick: [face frozen] Yes?
SpongeBob: [face frozen] I think we overdid it. [he and Patrick lean back up. Monroe approaches them, carrying popcorn. Upon seeing them, he starts screaming, throws his popcorn at them and runs away.]
Patrick: [face frozen] Hmm, debatable.
SpongeBob: [face frozen] Oh, I have an idea! Let us take a break in the theater. [cut to the outside of Glove World Theater.]
[Cut back to SpongeBob and Patrick. SpongeBob takes out a glove and slaps Patrick to get his face back to normal. Patrick takes the glove, adjusts it and slaps SpongeBob to get his face back to normal. They merrily walk into the theater. Cut to inside the theater where SpongeBob and Patrick are eating fries out of their hats. After finishing their fries, they put their hats back on and use their eyes to rip out eye holes in the hats. The currents open, revealing an animatronic. The audience begins to cheer.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: It's him! It's really him! [their hats point at the animatronic]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Right! It's me, Hieronymus Glove! I'm the bloomin' creator and spokes-mate of Glove World!
[An animatronic glove appears.]
Animatronic Glove: Glove World is a subsidiary of Finger Fun Industries. All rights reserved. [SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and headbutt each other as the show begins.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Welcome to the wonderfully whimsical and wickedly woven world of the glove! [Music begins playing and a giant glove-shaped screen appears. The screen powers on and displays two floating gloves and the words "Glove World Presents". SpongeBob and Patrick's pupils turn into gloves as Animatronic Hieronymus begins singing.] ♪If you want where something on your hand or fist, there's really nothing quite like gloves.♪ ♪And if you don't want to leave fingerprints, I've got a pair that you're just gonna love!♪ ♪If you want complete knuckle protection when you stick your hand inside a block of cheese, a glove's a thing you want, a glove's a thing you need, so wear a glove if you please!♪ [Animatronic gloves appear and start singing backup.]
Animatronic Gloves: ♪ Get yourself some fourchettes, gussets, tranks, and quirks! Slap a pair of thumbs on that and you've got a look that works!♪
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: ♪Queen Elizafish the First wore her gloves every day to preserve and protect her lovely mitts.♪ ♪Hats protect your head and shoes protect your feet, but gloves protect you from getting sick from everyone you meet.♪ ♪So if you want to build, or drive, or cook, or clean the loo, we have special glove made just for you!♪ ♪A glove is beyond compare, as essential as underwear! If I were you, I'd buy two!♪
[The show ends and the audience starts cheering. SpongeBob and Patrick headbutt each other again.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] That song reminds me of putting on a glove for the very first time. It was warm, and cozy, and sweaty.
Patrick: I wanna meet the glove guy!
SpongeBob: Ooh! [pulls out a bunch of gloves warped in a ball] Maybe he'll sign my gloves.
[Patrick makes his way to the stage, hopping over the seats. SpongeBob follows him and accidentally drops his gloves on the floor. While SpongeBob picks up his gloves, Patrick peeks through the curtains and sees the animatronic. He runs towards it and gives it a handshake.]
Patrick: [giggles excitedly] Oh, Mr. Glove, Mr. Glove! Oh, I'm your biggest fan! I've been all your rides, ask anyone! I'm here every weekend! And throwing up! [Patrick breaks the animatronic's hand.] Huh?
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: I need repair! I need repair!
Patrick: Oh! I'm sorry! It was an accident! [shushes the robot and puts his hand in his mouth] Please be quiet or I'll get in trouble! [Animatronic Hieronymus Glove keeps saying "I need repair!". The hand drops from the robot's mouth and rolls away. Patrick grabs Animatronic Hieronymus in a headlock and shushes him again.] Stupid! [shushes the animatronic once more] Shut up, shut up, shut up! [rips off Animatronic Hieronymus's head]
[SpongeBob comes in and sees Patrick destroying the animatronic.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing with our childhood hero? [accidentally press a button labeled "Run".]
Patrick: He wouldn't be quiet.
[Suddenly, the robot starts moving to the stage, pushing Patrick along with him. The curtains open to reveal Patrick holding Animatronic Hieronymus's head. As Patrick fumbles with the head, he notices everyone looking at him in shock. Dennis' glasses crack, and everyone screams. Patrick tries to put the head back on, but drops it. The audience members run out of the theater. Patrick trips over himself and brings down the curtains, and three Glove World officers enter from backstage.]
Officer #1: Freeze, vandals!
Patrick: [comes out of the curtains and uses the head to fight the officers off] Keep away! Keep away, no! No! Get away!
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, just calm down a second. Take a deep breath and hand me the head. [walks towards Patrick]
Officer #1: Better do what your friend says, son.
[Patrick calmly gives SpongeBob the head and starts crying]
SpongeBob: Oh, officers, he didn't mean to kill Hieronymus Glove! He just doesn't know his own strength. Or his own reflection. I don't know how he shaves!
[Close-up on Patrick's chin with rips, a bandage, stitches, and little hairs. SpongeBob begins to cry and blows his nose on the animatronic's head.]
Officer #1: He didn't kill anyone, kid. This is not a real head; it's an animatronomical dummy head.
Patrick: [angrily] Hey, who are calling a dummy head?! [confused] Wait, what did you say?
Officer #1: The real Hieronymus Glove has been frozen in ice for decades now. [shows SpongeBob and Patrick his hat which shows a picture of Hieronymus Glove frozen in an ice cube]
SpongeBob: [realizing] Oh, Patrick, it was only a robot head. Phew, for a minute there, I thought we were in trouble!
[SpongeBob and Patrick try to leave, but Officer #1 grabs them]
Officer #1: You are in trouble! And you're going to Glove World Jail!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [gasps] Glove World Jail?
SpongeBob: I thought that was an urban myth!
Patrick: You mean an urban truth.
SpongeBob and Patrick: Glove me! [The officer puts SpongeBob and Patrick in handcuffs. An elevator emerges from beneath the stage. SpongeBob, Patrick, and the three officers enter the elevator.] Jail time jack pot! [they high-five]
Officer #1: Please don't do that.
[SpongeBob and Patrick giggle as the elevator closes and descends into an underground jail. The elevator door opens to reveal that SpongeBob and Patrick have tangled Officer #1 in their handcuffs.]
SpongeBob: Sorry.
Patrick: Yeah, he's sorry.
[The officer takes SpongeBob and Patrick into Glove World Jail and throws them in a cell. They hit the wall, breaking their handcuffs, and fall into a ballpit filled with gloves.]
Officer #1: Alright, close number five!
[A small opening appears in the wall and three little gloves come out. SpongeBob and Patrick emerge from the ballpit to watch as the gloves do a little dance, then hop on top of each other and close the cell door. SpongeBob and Patrick cheer for them.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, this is exactly how I always thought Glove Jail would look!
Patrick: [pointing] Look!
[SpongeBob and Patrick lean against the bars and see three animatronic prisoners a nearby cell trying to get a key from an animatronic worm. They then look in the other direction and see two animatronic glove guards pacing back and forth, greeting each other repeatedly. Then they look behind them and see a barrel in the corner. They walk to the barrel and an animatronic old man pops out.]
Animatronic Old Man: Breaking the rules, eh? [laughs] Good for you, matey!
Patrick: Well, I didn't break the rules. I broke a dummy head.
Animatronic Old Man: Breaking the rules, eh? [laughs] Good for you, matey!
Patrick: I just told you! [leans into the barrel] Stop saying that!
Animatronic Old Man: [rams into Patrick as he pops back up] Breaking the rules, eh? [laughs]
Patrick: [grabs the animatronic old man in a choke hold] Shut up, shut up, shut up!
SpongeBob: Oh, not again, Patrick. He's just a robot! They're all robots. We're the only ones here. [A toddler pops out of the ball pit. While SpongeBob and Patrick are laughing, the toddler climbs up onto SpongeBob's head and pulls on his eyelashes.] Aww, hello there! What's a little guy like you doing in jail?
Patrick: Pooping without a license? [he and SpongeBob start laughing] You heard that, right?
SpongeBob: Pooping! License!
[As SpongeBob and Patrick continue to laugh, some other kids rise up from the ball pit. SpongeBob and Patrick notice them and scream in surprise.]
Patrick: Uh, hello?
SpongeBob: Oh, eh... Hello.
Prison Kid #1: Hey, man, what you in for?
SpongeBob: Defacing Glove World property.
Patrick: Allegedly!
SpongeBob: What are you all in for?
Prison Kid #2: [without any arms or legs] I didn't keep my arms and legs inside the ride at all times. [grows back his limbs]
Billy: [with a "Don't Stand Up" sign stuck on his head] I stood up at the top of the roller coaster.
Helen: [breaks the leg off of a doll she's holding] Murdered one! [bites the doll's leg and growls. The other kids take a step back] I'm kidding, I'm just here 'cause I bit the lemonade guy.
Billy: That guy hates kids!
Helen: That's why I bit him. High-five! [they high-five.]
[A kid comes up with cotton candy shaped like rats.]
Prison Kid #3: Let's celebrate! Cotton candy rats for everyone!
[The kids start cheering along with SpongeBob and Patrick as the cotton candy falls into Patrick's mouth. Patrick becomes hyper after eating the cotton candy. He jumps into the air.]
SpongeBob: Oh-oh, I think I smell a...
Patrick: Cannonball!
[Patrick jumps into the ball pit as the kids cheer and SpongeBob laughs. He then notices the toddler escaping through the bars and stops laughing.]
SpongeBob: Uh, hey, little guy, come back! You're too little to be on your own! [the toddler walks past an animatronic glove guard] Hey, Patrick, we've gotta...
[SpongeBob looks back and notices the kids playing with Patrick by spinning him around. SpongeBob then stretches his arm to try and grab the key from the animatronic worm, but winds up squeezing through the bars.]
Helen: [notices SpongeBob out of the cell.] Hey, you mugs, it's a jail break! Let's amscray!
[All the kids escape through the bars, and one of them jumps on SpongeBob's head as he leaves. Patrick, still spinning, runs into the bars and gets tangled in them. He then frees himself and SpongeBob stops him from spinning.]
Patrick: I think I stood up too quick.
SpongeBob: Come on, Patrick, we have to go after that escaped little boy!
Patrick: Looks like we all escaped.
SpongeBob: [walks towards a lever] I'll pull the escape alarm. We don't wanna break the law twice. [SpongeBob pulls the lever and the alarm goes off.] Huh?
Patrick: Huh! Is that the kid?
SpongeBob: Ah! That's him! Little boy, come back! I saved you a rat!
[Two repairmen walk by, carrying the pieces of Animatronic Hieronymus.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: I need repair! I need repair! [The repairmen enter a robotics lab. They place Animatronic Hieronymus's body on a chair and set his head down on a table.] I need repair! I need repair! I need repair! I need repair! [One of the repairmen browses his toolbox, pulls out a wrench, and whacks Animatronic Hieronymus's head with it.] Reboot, reboot. [closes his eyes, then opens them and looks around angrily]
Repairman #1: Alright, break time! [tosses his wrench aside]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Hey, you grease monkeys! No tea breaks! Put my head back on my body this bloomin' instant!
Repairman #2: Yeah, we'll get right on that... [mockingly] Gov'nor!
[both repairmen laugh and walk away while Animatronic Hieronymus growls at them. After they leave, the door slams and Animatronic Hieronymus's head falls into a bucket of nuts and bolts.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Whoaaaaaaaa! [Animatronic Hieronymus Glove shines a beam of light from his eye, projecting a memory of Patrick ripping off his head.] If I ever see that pink dimwitted dough boy again, I'll take his bloomin' head off! [turns himself around] Hmph!
[The episode continues with the toddler climbing a ladder. SpongeBob follows the toddler, stretches his arms, and grabs the toddler.]
SpongeBob: Gotcha! [SpongeBob jumps down and lands on the ground as Patrick runs to the ladder.] Better hold his hand. That way he won't wonder off. [They both hold the toddler's hand and continue down the hall. They enter a section with many doors.] Hmm, so many doors. [shifts his eyes around his body, twists himself, and spins] Which way should we go? [Two construction workers drive past them and four glove testers walk by. The glove testers step onto a conveyor belt, and Patrick follows closely behind.]
Patrick: I wanna ride the slide walk! [steps onto the conveyor belt, yanking SpongeBob and the toddler along with him.]
SpongeBob: Whoa! [his legs wobble as he tries to keep balance.]
Patrick: [lifts his arms up] This is crazy!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [reading a sign] "Danger: Glove Testing"? [excited] Ooooooooh-hoo-hoo-hoo! [Robotic arms descend from the ceiling and strap goggles on SpongeBob and Patrick. Another arm tries to put a pair of goggles on the toddler, but they're too big so the arm places the goggles around his shoulders like an oversized necklace. The group is brought to a window looking in on a room with a guy chained to two poles by his wrists. A ray gun and a flamethrower appear; the guy chuckles and gives a thumbs-up, and they zap him. SpongeBob covers the toddler's eyes. After the machines are done zapping the guy, robotic arms remove the gloves he was wearing, revealing that his hands are completely unscathed. The entire group claps and cheers.]
Patrick: A success. [The conveyor belt starts moving again. Two robotic arms flatten the glove testers, covering them in metal armor. They do the same to SpongeBob, Patrick, and the toddler. They approach a room labeled "Guard Glove Training".]
SpongeBob and Patrick: "Guard Glove Training"? [The group is brought into the room and the conveyor belt stops moving.]
Man On Speaker: Release the gloves. [A bell rings and some doors open, letting several guard gloves, glove-like dogs, run up to the group. Three of them run up to SpongeBob, Patrick, and the toddler, trying to bite through the armor.]
SpongeBob: Aww, they must smell Gary. [The camera zooms out, revealing two other guard gloves attacking the four glove testers. One of the glove testers has been knocked over and gets dragged off as a bell rings, signaling for the guard gloves to return to their kennels.]
Glove Tester: Tell Mom I love her! [The armor on SpongeBob, Patrick, and the toddler crumbles and breaks off. The conveyor belt starts moving again and they approach a room labeled "Sock World Prototype".]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh-oh-oh! "Sock World Prototype"? [They enter the room and see a sign that says "Sock World".]
Man On Speaker: Yes, Sock World! The eighth wonder of the seven seas! The experimental prototype smelly city... of the future! Please keep your nose pins on at all times [Two robot arms put nose pins on SpongeBob and Patrick. Another one puts a nose pin on the toddler.] 'Cause seriously, the stink is like... wow!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Stinky sock coasters are like... wow!
SpongeBob: Don't you love it, little guy? [SpongeBob and Patrick notice the little kid is gone.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Little guy! [they look behind them, and then back at each other.]
Patrick: Oh! Maybe he's hiding in my mouth! [opens his mouth] Is he in there?
SpongeBob: [hears the toddler laughing and points in the distance] There he is!
Patrick: Ahhh, get him out of there! Ah! I'm not hungry yet! [The toddler pops up from a pile of gloves near some barrels, and runs off.]
SpongeBob: Let's go! [grabs Patrick's hand and runs after the toddler, pulling Patrick along.] [The toddler enters the robotic lab. He hops into Animatronic Hieronymus Glove's body, then grabs his broken hand. He tries to put the hand back in place, but gives up and tosses it aside. Animatronic Hieronymus Glove pops out of the bucket and gets hit by his own hand. The little kid stands up with the body and tries to keep his balance, crashing into many things. He then gains his balance with the body and walks out of the lab. Animatronic Hieronymus Glove pops out of the bucket and notices the kid with his body.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Gah, thief! That's Glove World's bloomin' property! [falls back into the bucket] [SpongeBob and Patrick enter the lab and run into the toddler but don't recognize him.]
SpongeBob: Oh, uh, after you, sir. [the toddler leaves the lab.] Oh, I don't see the kid, Patrick.
Patrick: Pardon me, gents. Did anyone seen a little kid come through? [They look around the room and see robot parts everywhere.]
SpongeBob: Oh!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Robot morgue? Cool! [SpongeBob and Patrick pretend to be robots.]
SpongeBob: Beep boop! Beep beep boop! Beep! Beep! Beep! Boop!
Patrick: Errr, eeeh! Beeeep, beep! Beep, boop, beep! [They walk over to some hanging robots and shake hands with them, but they get electrocuted.] Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [Water is sprayed on them, and they turn around.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Huh? [They see the toddler holding a bucket. The toddler giggles and runs off.]
Patrick: Hey, did that kid eat a robot? Or did that robot eat a kid?
SpongeBob: Either way, it's probably against the rules. Let's get him! [They run after the kid as Animatronic Hieronymus Glove pops out of the bucket.]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: It's the blinking bloke that broke off me melon! Whoaaa! [the bucket falls over and he picks himself up. He notices his hand on the floor and jumps on it to attach it to the bottom of his head] Aha! Nobody breaks off my bloomin' head and gets away with it! [wires come out of his mouth] I'M HIERONYMUS GLOVE! [An animatronic glove appears.]
Animatronic Glove: This robot head does not reflect the views of Finger Fun Industries. [The animatronic glove disappears and Animatronic Hieronymus exits the lab, chuckling evilly. Back down the hall, SpongeBob and Patrick are chasing after the toddler.]
Patrick: Ahhhhhhh!
SpongeBob: Come here, little guy! That's a good boy! [the toddler opens a door and runs inside, with SpongeBob and Patrick following closely behind him. Animatronic Hieronymus arrives, headbutts a panel, and uses his wires to tamper with some circuitry, setting off an alarm.] D'ah! Wait up, little guy! [The floor tilts downward and they all fall, landing on a slide that takes them to a giant dryer-themed ride.] D'oh...gotcha! [he and Patrick grab the toddler's hands]
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Let's see if these bloomin' bozos like this blinking blimey ride! [hits himself with his own hand, turns himself into a coin, and puts himself in the ride's giant coin slot. The ride starts, spinning SpongeBob, Patrick, and the toddler so fast they get pinned to the wall.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ahhh! Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-whoaaaaaaaaa! Woah-woah-woaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! [the ride stops and they all fall to the floor, landing in a pile of clean socks.] [tired] Woo-hoo! [the floor bottoms out, dropping them all down, Animatronic Hieronymus goes down after them.] Aaaaaaaaaah!
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Hahaha!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Aaah-- huh? Woo-hoo!
Animatronic Hieronymus Glove: Hahahahahahahahahahahaha! [they all land in a much larger pile of clean socks.]
SpongeBob: Mmmm, warm socks just out of the dryer... [they all sink into the socks, and then SpongeBob and Patrick resurface.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oooh! [Patrick, wearing a sock over his head, uses his eyes to rip out eye holes in the sock. The scene cuts to a view of Sock World.] Huhhhhhhhh? Ahhhhhhhh! There really is a Sock World! [they grin excitedly, but then a strong stench approaches and they shrivel up.] And it really does stink! Oooh-hoo-hoo! [the toddler comes out from the sock pile and is disgusted by the smell. SpongeBob walks up and grabs his hand.]
SpongeBob: Ewww! This place is the greatest, but I wish I could turn the smell down a scotch.
Patrick: Hey, I found the stink switch! [he pulls a nose-shaped lever and the stench goes away.]
SpongeBob: Yay, Patrick! See, little guy? Everything is gonna be just... [he notices that the toddler is gone, and he is only holding a disembodied animatronic hand] FINE! [he tosses the hand aside and frantically looks for the toddler. Upbeat banjo music plays as the toddler runs playfully around Sock World, with the handless arms of Animatronic Hieronymus's body flailing behind him. The sparks coming out of the arms set fire to three animatronic socks, and the banjo music dies down as the animatronics melt. SpongeBob whistles.] Patrick! [Patrick runs up and SpongeBob jumps on his back.] Follow that kid!
Patrick: Vroom-oom-oom-oom! [runs off with SpongeBob on his back. Animatronic Hieronymus pops out of the sock pile. His two disembodied hands fist-bump each other and attach themselves to the bottom of his head, and he chases after SpongeBob and Patrick.]
'Animatronic Hieronymus Glove:' Hoohahaha!
[the toddler runs up to a water ride and boards one of the cars.]
SpongeBob: He's headed for the Soggy Sock Flume!
Patrick: The first time you called me your best friend was on the Glove Flume!
SpongeBob: Awww! [hugs Patrick.] AHHH! Stop, best friend! Stop! [Patrick tries to stop running but rams into the side of the Soggy Sock Flume, sending them both flying. They land upside-down in one of the cars.]
SpongeBob: Ah! Woah!
Patrick: Woah! Woah?! Huh? Wahoo!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they adjust themselves and notice that the toddler is in the car in front of them.] There he is!
SpongeBob: Don't worry, kid, we're right behind you! [the toddler looks back at them and giggles. Animatronic Hieronymus appears in the water and swims up to SpongeBob and Patrick's car.] Stay right there! We're coming!
Patrick: Don't stand up or they'll put you in Sock Jail!
'Animatronic Hieronymus Glove:' Baaaaaaaaaah! [bites off the back of the car]
Patrick: Do you feel a draft, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: I was gonna ask you the same thing... [Animatronic Hieronymus bites Patrick's butt]
Patrick: Aaaaaaaaah! Do you feel a pain in your butt?
SpongeBob: No. [Animatronic Hieronymus bites SpongeBob's butt] Ayyyyyye! Now I do! Gaaaaaah!
Patrick: Oooo-ooow!
[the cars reach the top of the ride and start sliding down. SpongeBob and Patrick scream while the toddler squeals in delight. The toddler gets sucked out of Animatronic Hieronymus's body due to the sheer speed, but pulls himself back in. The cars reach the bottom of the ride and the toddler uses it to hop out of the water and jump around Sock World with it. SpongeBob and Patrick follow suit and try to catch him.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, no more playing footsies! We gotta save that kid! [they take a huge jump and land in front of the toddler.] Now we gotcha!
Toddler: Huh?
'Animatronic Hieronymus Glove:' [reattaches his hand to his body] Come here, you little whippersnapper! [grabs the toddler and reattaches his head and other hand to his body] Now I've got YOU!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Hieronymus Glove's robot!
SpongeBob: Hey, you found the kid! Thanks, we'll take him off your hands now!
'Animatronic Hieronymus Glove:' Sure, you can have him. [points at Patrick] Right after I take off his bloomin' head!
SpongeBob: [gasps and steps in front of Patrick] Nooooo! [Patrick brushes him aside and pulls his own head off.]
Patrick: [offering his head to the surprised Animatronic Hieronymus] Here you go, I did it for you.
'Animatronic Hieronymus Glove:' [Disappointed and angry] Awww, I wanted to do it! That's the whole point, you pink plonker! [slaps Patrick's head away]
SpongeBob: [catches Patrick's head] Hot potato! [tosses it to Patrick]
Patrick: [fumbles with his head] Huh? Ha! Huh? Woah! [tosses it back to SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: [fumbles with the head] Heads up! [tosses it to Animatronic Hieronymus. He catches it and throws the toddler to SpongeBob. SpongeBob makes a kid-sized pouch with his body and puts the toddler in it.] I should've done this hours ago! Oh, that's a good boy! [pats the toddler's head]
Patrick: I don't know what a pink plonker is, but I don't like it! [punches Animatronic Hieronymus with his tongue, knocking his head off.]
'Animatronic Hieronymus Glove:' Aaaaaaaaah!
Patrick: [attaches himself to Animatronic Hieronymus's body] Ooh! Hey! I like this body better than mine...it comes with pockets!
'Animatronic Hieronymus Glove:' I like my new body too! [walks up using Patrick's body which he struggles to control ] But I still want that head! [tries to fight Patrick]
Patrick: I said I was sorry, you weirdo! [they continue fighting, and knock each other's heads off. The heads keep fighting on the ground and SpongeBob jumps to avoid them while the toddler laughs and claps.]
'Hieronymus Glove:' Enough! [the heads stop fighting, and the real Hieronymus Glove, stuck in a block of ice, rolls up to them while a pair of servants sweep the ground in front of him.] No, no, this won't do at all! Put those heads back on post-haste! [the servants toss their brooms aside and walk towards the group] Splendid!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Wow! [the servants put Patrick's head back on his body] Are you the real Hieronymus Glove?
'Animatronic Hieronymus Glove:' [the servants put Animatronic Hieronymus's head back on his body] No, he's not, I'm the real Hieronymus Glove!
'Hieronymus Glove:' Hahahaha, splendid! Do wipe that one's memory bank before he does more damage to my park. Thank you! [one of the servants whacks Patrick's head with a giant wrench] Not him, the other one!
'Animatronic Hieronymus Glove:' Hmm? [the servant whacks Animatronic Hieronymus's head with the wrench] Ow! Re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-- and that's why we wear gloves on our hands and not on our knees! Haha... [he powers down and falls over. The servants catch him and carry him away.]
'Hieronymus Glove:' Splendid! I'm afraid I'm the real Hieronymus Glove, and I'm at your service.
SpongeBob and Patrick: We love your gloves!
'Hieronymus Glove:' Splendid! And since being terrorized by our robots has never been Glove World policy, you are all hereby released from Glove Jail!
SpongeBob and Patrick: We've been pardoned! Splendid!
'Hieronymus Glove:' Splendid! And for proving yourselves to be unselfish and kind, I'm going to give all of Glove World to the both of you!
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ahhhhhh! [the servants weld crowns to SpongeBob and Patrick's heads] Really?
'Hieronymus Glove:' Of course not! Hahahahaha! I may be cryogenically frozen, but I'm not a loony! [they all laugh, and the floor rises up to take them back to Glove World as Hieronymus begins singing]
'Hieronymus Glove:' ♪Well, that concludes our show and as you can see, there still is nothing quite like gloves!♪ ♪Until we meet again for a shopping spree, where I hope you buy all kinds of gloves to love!♪ ♪With the handy help of SpongeBob and Patrick, we defeated my crazy robot head!♪ ♪Now that the twit is gone...♪
'Animatronic Hieronymus Glove:' ♪Glove World can carry on!♪
'Hieronymus Glove:' ♪And the toddler can go to bed. Goodnight!♪
[SpongeBob and Patrick fall asleep as the curtains go down. The toddler jumps out of their arms and runs off, waking them up.]
Patrick: Hey! [they go running after him]
SpongeBob: Come back here, little guy!
Patrick: I saved you a Ham Fist!
