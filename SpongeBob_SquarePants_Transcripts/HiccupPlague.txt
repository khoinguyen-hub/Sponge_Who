[The episode begins at a tree house, where two kids are laughing.]
Timmy: [takes out a can of Fizz Bomb soda and drinks it, then burps] How's that, Tina?
Tina: No, Timmy, we want a hiccup. [holds some Spicy Kelp Chips] Try this!
[Tina putting Spicy Kelp Chips in mouth and gives some to Timmy, then they eat it, then their mouths are burning, then they went to the floor, then hiccup, then the hiccup bubbles combined and Tina gets the jar to put the bubble in]
Tina: Yes, we have created the worst case of hiccups in history! [laughs]
Timmy: This is gonna make a great prank.
[They release the hiccup bubble into Bikini Bottom, which is about to land on an old woman, but she unknowingly blows it away while blowing her nose.]
[The hiccup bubble then lands on SpongeBob while he's whistling and skipping down the street.]
SpongeBob: [laughs] It tickles! [hiccup] What was that? [hiccups while Tina and Timmy laugh]
[Later, at The Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is about to prepare a fresh batch of Krabby Patties, but his hiccups interfere. At first, SpongeBob uses this to his advantage, using his hiccups to bounce the Krabby Patties off of his head, but this quickly spirals out of control.]
Squidward: SpongeBob! Hurry up with that order! [gets patty on eye and Squidward gets it off] Mr. Krabs! SpongeBob is up to more nonsense again! [gasps and avoids patties and Nat’s Krabby Patty gets more Krabby Patties in until one Patty knocks him out]
Mr. Krabs: [sighs] 2 whole days without nonsense, for a good run, Mr. Squidward. But we both knew it couldn’t last. [enters kitchen] SpongeBob, what shenanigans are you up to now?
SpongeBob: [hiccups, then a patty hits the ceiling] I— [hiccup] hiccup— [hiccup] down with something, Mr. Kra— [hiccup]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] You just got a case of the hiccups, son.
SpongeBob: Are they dangerous?
Mr. Krabs: No, of course not! And I [tucks his pants] have a foolproof hiccup cure. Using an old navy trick.
SpongeBob: "Old navy trick?" [gulps] Okay. Go for it.
Mr. Krabs: Boo.
SpongeBob: [screams] Huh? I'm cured! [laughs but hiccups again]
Mr. Krabs: Eugh. This might be a tougher case than I thought. Why don't you go home and sleep it off? [patty falls from ceiling]
SpongeBob: Oh, but I don’t wanna go... [hiccups one last time and the hiccup bubble comes out of SpongeBob and goes to Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [shakes his head] Uh, sorry, boy-o.
SpongeBob: Oh, stupid hiccups. [notices his hiccups are gone] Hey hey, they're gone! [whistles while walking away]
Mr. Krabs: [hiccups] Oh... hiccups. Hiccups are nothing to a old navy man like me. [hiccups and laughs while leaving the kitchen]
Mrs. Puff: Hello, Eugene. [pinches cheek] How’s my little Krabby-Wabby-Oooooh?
Mr. Krabs: Doing fine now that you're here, Puffykins. [hiccups then covers mouth and hiccups while eyes pop out]
Mrs. Puff: Oh my! Are you alright?
Mr. Krabs: [muffles mouth and tells the truth] SpongeB— [hiccups] given me a case of— [hiccups] hiccups!
Mrs. Puff: Oh Eugene, hiccups aren't contagious. [kisses Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: [hiccups one last time and the hiccup bubble is out of Mr. Krabs and gets to Ms. Puff then he laughs] Me hiccups! They're gone! Oh your kisses are magical, Puff!
Mrs. Puff: Oh Eu- [hiccups] Dear me! I have to— [hiccups] powder my gills! [hiccups and enters bathroom] I got to get rid of these rotten hiccups before I pop! [hiccups and turns on sink and drinks water]
Pearl: Oh hi Mrs. Puff?
Mrs. Puff: Oh hello- [water comes out of her mouth and getting Pearl wet]
Pearl: Ohh... my pompoms.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, Pearl, I'm so sorry. [hiccups one last time and the hiccup bubble is out of Mrs. Puff and gets to Pearl]
Pearl: [gasps and get out of the bathroom]
Mrs. Puff: Oh! My hiccups. They've stopped.
