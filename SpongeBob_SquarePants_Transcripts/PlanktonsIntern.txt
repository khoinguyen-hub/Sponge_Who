[At the Chum Bucket while Plankton struggles to build his new invention]
Plankton: Karen, can you give me a hand with my new Dodanatron?
Karen: Sorry Sheldon, I'm off to visit my Motherboard.
Plankton: [gasps] Wait! How am I suppose to get anything done without you?
Karen: Don't worry, I put up Help Wanted flyers for an intern. See? [Karen throws intern flyer and it flies until it reaches Planktonâ€™s eye]
Plankton: [sees flyer] "INTERN WANTED." Apply today at Chum Bucket Labs? [crumbles flyer] I'm a mad scientist! If getting help was that easy, I wouldn't have built a computer wife!
Person: Is this where I apply for the intern job?
Plankton: [sees line]
[In the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: Ahem. Hello and welcome to Chum Bucket Labs. As an intern you will gain valuable work experience and a sub-minimum wage. [the crowd sighs and leaves, leaving only Patrick] Well that narrowed it down.
Patrick: I wanna do the science!
Plankton: [quietly] Oh boy.
Plankton: Okay, let's see how ya handle scientific equipment. This is my Duplo Maker! It's very, very simple.
Patrick: Oh, like me!
Plankton: [takes out a coin] Just put this coin in the chamber-
Patrick: Gotcha! [grabs the coin and squishes Plankton]
Plankton: Ow! No! Just the coin, you idiot! [he gasps]
[The Duplo Maker creates a whole lot of Patrick doubles. It is no longer duplicating Patrick as the door opens and many Patricks appear. Plankton then screams and runs as a Patrick double tries to land on him, but fails]
Plankton: Oh.
Patricks: Do we get the job?
Plankton: I'll tell ya what ya get. [takes out a console] You get out! [pushes the button in the console and a robot hand with a glove takes away the Patricks from the Chum Bucket]
Patrick: Hi, I'm Patrick.
Another Patrick: No, I'm Patrick.
Another another Patrick: Who's Patrick?
Plankton: Well, great. Not a single applicant left.
Pearl: Hello? I'm still here.
Plankton: [shouting] Whale! [Pearl steps closer to him as he climbs up to his desk] No! Not you! Whales eat Plankton!
Pearl: I don't eat Plankton. That's baby food. I'm just here for the job.
Plankton: Really? You're not gonna eat me?
Pearl: Eww, no! I just need money, but my dad's such a skinflint with my allowance.
Plankton: Alright, you're hired. Whatever.
[Transition to net scene at the Chum Bucket.]
Plankton: As the junior intern of Chum Bucket, you're responsible for extremely important tasks.
Pearl: Oh wow! Like what? [Plankton is then seen standing on Pearl to reach for a high-up object] Uhh.
Plankton: [screws a lightbulb onto a robot] You'll make an excellent ladder, junior intern. [he finishes screwing in the lightbulb] Yes! My evil robot is complete! [he jumps up onto it and goes inside it. The robot comes alive and starts walking shortly after] Nothing can stop me now! [he tries squeezing through a door but is too big to do so. The robot sputters and explodes. Plankton, still inside the robot's intact head, comes rolling towards Pearl. A tiny door on the head opens, revealing him]
Pearl: Except that tiny doorway.
Plankton: No one asked you, junior intern. And by the way, [he holds up something] I forgot you give you your very own lab instrument.
Pearl: [she holds the object] Ooh! What's it do? [the object unfolds, revealing it to be a broom and Pearl is launched across the room]
Plankton: Why don't ya push it around and find out?
[transition to next scene]
Plankton: Observe, my lonely intern, and tremble at the power of my mighty, uh, laser thingy. [he takes a curtain off his large invention] It'll blow the door off a safe. [he presses a red button on the invention. A tiny hand holding a laser gun comes out and shoots the gun.
Hand: Pew! [the laser hits the safe, causing the same to turn into smithereens.]
Plankton: [Sighs] And everything in it. Get to work, intern.
Pearl: Okay. [she sweeps the floor using the broom]
[transition to next scene, where Pearl is about to dunk Plankton into a pool]
Plankton: Behold my instant monster maker. Yes! The creature is strong enough to open a safe with it's bare hands!
Pearl: Tentacles.
Plankton: Their tentacles are even worse.
Pearl: Eww! Gross!
Plankton: Don't bother sweeping it up.
Pearl: Thanks Mr. Plankton.
Plankton: Your gonna need a mop.
Mr. Krabs: How was your day at your first summer job sweetie?
Pearl: It's so boring. My boss doesn't let me do any of the fun stuff.
Mr. Krabs: Now, now my little daughter, work ain't supposed to be fun.
Pearl: But daddy-
Mr. Krabs: It don't matter who your boss is, a good employee follows the boss's orders.
Pearl: If you say so daddy.
Plankton: I'll just power up this. Install the free range poultry, plus a final adjustment.
Pearl: Morning Boss.
Plankton: Watch it! This instrument is very delicate.
Pearl: Can i help with a cool science stuff today Mr. Plankton? Please?
Plankton: Can you materialize me a Krabby Patty Junior Intern?
Pearl: No.
Plankton: Didn't think so.
Pearl: But i can give you the recipe.
Plankton: What? [Smiles] You can get mr Krab's secret formula?
Pearl: Well he is my dad.
Plankton: Eugene Krabs is your father?
Pearl: Duh. Everyone knows that.
Plankton: Are you free to attend a conference tonight Senior Intern?
Pearl: Oh yes.
[Later That Night]
Pearl: Thanks for the advice daddy. I already got a promotion and i'm working an extra shift tonight. Love ya.
Mr. Krabs: Remember the bossalwys knows best.
Plankton: Overlord to flunky, come in flunky.
Pearl: Flunky here. I read you overlord. Over.
Plankton: Give me a boost up to the window. Over.
Pearl: You got it boss. Over.
Pearl: I forgot i had a spare key.
Plankton: Somebody's coming. Hide.
Plankton: Is that SpongeBob? He should be home in bed. Let's get outta here.
Pearl: Wait, i think he's sleep cooking.
Plankton: He's more oblivious than usual. He has no idea what's going on.
Plankton: [grunts] Hey, hey, hey! [cackles]
Pearl: Shh! You're gonna wake him up!
[Plankton continues to bounce on SpongeBob's nose laughing until SpongeBob grabs him.]
Plankton: Huh? [SpongeBob smacks him onto the grill] Oww!
[Muffled whimpers come from Plankton as SpongeBob hits him with his spatula. Pearl groans over the sounds.]
Plankton: Over. [SpongeBob hits him more. Plankton whimpers as SpongeBob puts salt, pepper and cheese on him and flips him onto the bottom bun he is holding. He then squirts mayonnaise on the cheese] Mayonnaise? Eww! [SpongeBob puts on the top bun, squashing Plankton. He exits the kitchen]
SpongeBob: [snores] Order up!
[Pearl dashes out the kitchen, grabs SpongeBob and the patty and throws SpongeBob into the trash can. SpongeBob continues snoring inside the trash can. Plankton lifts up the burger contents.]
Plankton: Huh? [throws the contents away] Why didn't I think of that? [cut to Pearl and Plankton emerging from the cashier boat]
SpongeBob: Where am i? [gasps] Plankton.
Mr. Krabs: Money? I mean. Hello?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: I'm not singing anymore lullaby's SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: No, i'm at the Krusty Krab. Plankton and a giant goon are trying to steal the secret forumla.
Mr. Krabs: Me formuler? I'll be right there boyo.
Plankton: What's your plan to open the safe? Power drill? Explosives?
Pearl: Nah, i'll just use the combination.
Plankton: Diabolical!
Plankton: I can almost taste that Krabby Patty now. The formula is mine.
Mr. Krabs: You'll have to get past me first Plankton.
Plankton: Krabs.
SpongeBob: And you'll have to get past me too.
Mr. Krabs: Tell your giant goon to hand over me forumler Plankton.
Pearl: Daddy, i'm a flunky not a goon.
Mr. Krabs: Pearl? What are you doing with me enemy?
Pearl: Working with Plankton is my summer job. I was just doing what you said. Remember a good employee follows their boss's orders.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah but your boss is- Oh me and my big mouth. You don't have to work for him. You can come work for me.
Plankton: Your too late Krabs. Your daughter works for me now.
Pearl: I'll give you back the formula daddy. On one condition... triple my allowance. I don't have to work for anyone anymore.
Mr. Krabs: Triple? Oh alright.
Pearl: Sorry Mr. Plankton, but i quit.
Plankton: Sweet Neptune! She is gonna eat me.
Plankton: You can forget that letter of recommendation.
Karen: Sheldon i'm back. So how did your day go?
Plankton: Don't ask.
