[The episode starts at the Chum Bucket, which the bucket's handle falls to the ground, this is because Plankton and Karen are coming out of it, with a hot air balloon shaped like a heart for a date.]
Karen: Ah, I'm floating on air! A balloon ride, a candle-light dinner, and our wedding song is playing! Oh, this day is perfect.
Plankton: No, you're perfect, Karen. You're the best computer wife a copepod ever could have! [types on keyboard] Bon-bon?
Karen: Oh, I shouldn't.
Karen: Thank you, Plankton. This is truly a date to remember.
Plankton: Well, my love, you haven't seen anything yet. [runs dressed as Ray Ray] For you, my love! [passes a rose to Karen using his tongue]
Karen: Oh, Ray Ray! [laughs and sniffs rose] Aah.
Plankton: [combs hair] That's right, baby. Ray Ray is at your service. [shines teeth]
Karen: Ray Ray, you've got my cooling fans running on high. [grabs Plankton and knocks down table] Ha, ha. Get over here and give me some sugar! [as Plankton and Karen are about to kiss, Plankton sees Mr. Krabs down from above.]
Plankton: Huh?
Mr. Krabs: ♪Do do do do do♪ [yawns] What a long day. [he gets in his boat as he leaves the formula from behind.]
Plankton: [looks down at the formula] [angelic singing] Uh...eh...ehh! Ahhh! I can't take it!
Karen: What is it, Plankton?
Plankton: Hold that thought, baby. I uh- I forgot something down here. I'll be right back! [jusps off from the balloon] Can't believe this is really happening. [falls to the ground] The Krabby Patty secret formula is finally mine! Huh? [goes thru the formula, every time he touches it, his hand goes thru the formula] Huh? Eh... [The formula disappears] Ehh! [looks for the formula] Hm, eh, ah, eh, eh! Is this some kind of horrible nightmare? What? [goes back into the Chum Bucket, just to find the projector 3000.] A projector? You tricked me with a simulation?
Karen: It was a test, Plankton! And you failed! You fail every time when it comes to our romance.
Plankton: Right, so I goof up one time and now I'm the bad guy?
Karen: One time? Failed one time? [Numbers show up on her screen] How about 4,700,000 and- [glitching] Error, er-er-error.
Plankton: But baby cakes, I left to go get the Krabby Patty secret formula. For me... and you... You know... for us! Ehhh?
Karen: Listen, Sheldon. You need to show me a interruption-free romantic date night because until that happens, no one is leaving the Chum Bucket. [presses an alarm that makes the place go on lockdown]
Plankton: Aah! [a brick wall crushes the front doors as the Chum Bucket's glove grabs some tinfoil as it places it on top of the roof and puts a rubber band on it.] [Karen grabs Plankton] Oof!
Karen: You better not mess this one up, Ray Ray. [pushes Plankton off her hand]
Plankton: Ah! [bubble translation cuts to the next scene] ♪Da da da da doo doo♪ I think Karen's favorite "scrap electronics stew" ought to do the trick. [laughing] Yep. Huh? [notices that there is a window] I guess it wouldn't hurt to have just a little peek at the Krusy Krab. [climbs on the window] Hmm.
Mr. Krabs: ♪Dee dee doo dee♪ What a long day. [yawns] [he gets in his boat and leaves the formula behind again.]
Plankton: [gasps] It's really out there! And this time it's not a hologram! [scratching the window and whimpering] [gets a screwdriver to untwist one of the nails attached to the window.] Uh, uh..
Karen: [clears throat] Plankton! What are you doing?
Plankton: Oh, hey, baby! Just adding the finishing touches to tonight's main course!
Karen: Aww, you are so sweet! I can't wait to try it! [Plankton kisses her screen]
Plankton: Whew! Good one, Plankton. The formula! Now how am I gonna get you? [breeze blows as the formula rolls to the Chum Bucket.] Yes, yes, yes! [boat runs over the formula] No, no, no! Slow it down, you maniac! [panting] Who's that?
Patrick: Krabby Patty! Krabby Patty!
Plankton: Eesh. It's that numbskull Patrick. [gets a microphone] Hey, doofus! I mean, star friend.
Patrick: Krabby Patty. [he stops]
Plankton: Over here.
Patrick: Hmm?
Plankton: No, over here! Come on. [Patrick finally looks at the Chum Bucket] Yes, that's it. You've got it. Now who's a good boy? [Patrick painting] Okay, now grab that bottle by your feet there. ''[Patrick grabs drink container] No. [sighs] The other drink container by your feet.
Patrick: Hmmm.
Plankton: Pick that one up instead.
Patrick: [looks at the Krusty Krab] Uh?
Plankton: By your feet.
Patrick: Huh? Uh?
Plankton: Now look right!
Patrick: Oh, huh! [drops his head into the ground]
Plankton: You have got to be kidding me. Right, Patrick!
Patrick: Uh?
Plankton: Your other right!
Patrick: Oh! [looks at formula]
Plankton: Yes! [laughter] That's it, huh!
Patrick: Ah! [picks up formula]
Plankton: Good boy. Now bring it over here to me. Yes, that's it! Huh? [he notices that Patrick is gone.] Oh, where did he go?! [sees Patrick in the Chum Bucket out of nowhere]
Patrick: Excuse me, are you the window cleaner?
Plankton: How in barnacles did you get in here?
Patrick: I don't know?
Plankton: Well, who cares? Did you bring that bottle I told you to bring?
Patrick: Uh-huh. [shows Plankton drink bottle] Tastes kind of funny, though. [drinks the bottle] No, I said the other one, you moron! [looks at the window as Larry is exercising with people]
Larry: Hey, you guys are doing great! [rolls the formula] Two, there, four!
Plankton: A thin piece of glass is all that stands between me and what I want most in the world. Why is life so unfair?
Karen: Oh, honey? Is dinner almost ready? I'm famished!
Plankton: [he gets nervous] Uh, it's almost finished, my sweetheart! What am I gonna do? Think, Plankton, think! Oh? [Pulls off his hair] Idea! [Plankton shows his hair at Patrick] That's it! Karen will never know the difference! Now I think I got what I need right here. [grabs a saw] Patrick, you may feel a slight tickle.
Patrick: Oh, I like tickles. [Plankton saws Patrick into Ray Ray]
Plankton: Okay, let's get a look at this.
Patrick: Ha, ha! That was intense!
Plankton: Oop! Almost forgot. [he tears off Patrick's right eye.]
Patrick: Ha, ha. Ow!
Plankton: You're going on a date with my wife Karen, Ray Ray.
Patrick: Oh, but I sound like Patrick.
Plankton: Oh, no. You keep your mouth shut. I will take care of that. [he puts a microphone in his tooth] [high-pitched feedback] [chuckles] Oh, Karen? Dinner is served, my little love nugget!
Karen: Oh, my gosh. This looks amazing! I loves my Ray Ray. [growls and giggles]
Plankton: And I love my Karen. Now let's dig in! [Ray Ray known as Patrick puts the spoon in his mouth and chews it.]
Karen: [giggling] [bubble translation continues to the next scene.]
Plankton: [lights a lighter] Krabby Patty secret formula, here I come! [cuts the lighter into the wall]
Karen: Ow! That's a little rough, Ray Ray. [Patrick biting one of Karen's wheels] Ow, Plankton! What are you doing? [Plankton grabs Patrick's hands and has him massage Karen] Ohh. Oh, that feels nice. Ahh, okay. Goodnight.
Plankton: Whew! That was close. [bubble transitions to the next scene]
