[the episode begins at a place called "Animal Shelter."]
[the camera goes inside the place, and there is a snail trying to grab a key next to him to get out.]
[animal sounds]
SpongeBob: Hello, animal control. Ew.
Marvin: SpongeBob, I appreciate you volunteering here at the animal shelter, but could you please stop letting the worms use the phone?
SpongeBob: Oh, I told them no more takeout calls.
[belches] [groans]
Marvin: [on the phone] Now, how can I help you?
Squidward: There's a worm somewhere outside my house, and it won't stop barking.
Marvin: I'll get on that right away.
[animal sounds]
Marvin: I gotta go catch a stray. SpongeBob, you hold down the fort.
SpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir! I will take care of these wild worms to the best of my ability. [laughs and sighs] [humming while walking over to a cage and then gasps] Uh-oh. B-B-Butcher's cage. [nervous whimpering]
Butcher: [barks] [screams]
SpongeBob: Butcher? I know you're really a good boy. Just let me pet you, real gentle. That's a boy.
Butcher: [growls and snarls]
SpongeBob: [gasps] I hope he doesn't develop a taste for sponge..
[screams] [animal sounds]
[straining]
[barking]
Whoa--whoa!
[barking] Whoa-whoa.
[barking]
Patrick.
Yeah, aw--who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
[panting] Huh?
Patrick's my friend. Sometimes if he's eaten worm food by mistake, he goes into worm mode.
[growls]
There's no telling how long it'll last.
Well, if he's not trained in a few days so he can be adopted, he'll have to be locked up. Like Butcher.
[growls]
Don't worry, sir. I'll train him. He's already housebroken.
[nervous laughs] I knew he was broken. I thought it was the house.
Uh... Now, Patrick, every good worm needs to learn how to do tricks. Then they get wormy treats as a reward!
Now, sit!
[excited barks]
Um...almost. Let's try another one. Shake!
[excited barks]
[pants] Shall we try roll over?
[excited barks]
Patrick, wait.
[crashing]
Rolling Star Express, right on time.
[pants]
I know one wormy that needs a bath.
[growls]
Okay, okay, no bath, no bath.
Here, Patrick. Worms learn from other worms. They'll show you how to be a good boy.
Hmm?
[sophisticated barks] [cheers]
[gasps]
[barks]
Huh?
This worm is a menace. I'm afraid he'll have to be locked up, like Butcher.
Please don't do that! I'll adopt him. I'll take him home! He'll be my rescue.
And you'll take full responsibility for him?
I promise.
Well, that's good. I really didn't want to have to fix him, anyway.
[excited barks]
Thank you, thank you.
Patrick, whoa, boy. Heel. Sorry.
Oh, Gary...! I brought you a playmate!
[meows]
[barks]
[screeches]
[barks]
[animal sounds]
Patrick, Gary, no, stop!
[barking]
Hmm?
[meows]
[barking]
[barking]
[rooster crows]
SpongeBob!
Come on.
[groans] I'm sorry. Was the noise bothering you?
[barking]
Patrick, heel!
[yells]
[barking]
[gasping] Jeez.
[meows]
Huh. Look.
I don't care what kind of weird and stupid parties you throw, I'm just asking that you keep your pet quiet. I am at my wit's end!
Patrick is in worm mode again. But this time, he's out of control.
Oh, any worm can be tamed. Even one as dumb as Patrick. He just needs tough love.
Would you tough-love Patrick, Squidward?
No way.
[barking]
Please, Squidward. I bet you're the best worm trainer ever. Please.
[laughs] Beg me.
[barks]
Okay, sit.
Huh?
Well, I'm a good idiot trainer. And since Patrick's an idiot... Okay, I'll train him. But only if you play dead--
[gasps]
[laughs] And stay playing dead. I've got an idiot to train.
[straining]
We'll start with something simple: I'll teach you how to heel. Now...be a good boy.
[growls] [screams]
Heel--stop! Heel!
[growls]
All right, that's it. [pants] Have a nice life.
[coyote howls]
[hums] Hi, Squidward! I'm still playing dead. [laughs]
[hums]
Tough love. [laughs]
Huh? [pounding on door]
[pants] [winces]
This, my little barking friend, is a shock collar. Whenever you bark, I'll push this button and give you a tough-love shock.
[pants]
Hmm? Nothing? Oh, it must be broken.
[grunts] Nuts.
[screams]
[barks]
Still playing dead!
[mutters]
[screams]
[growls]
[nervous whimper]
[grunts]
[barks]
[pants]
[whimpers]
[barks]
Excuse, Mr. Squidward. SpongeBob tells me that you've trained Patrick using tough love.
Patrick? He's impossible. I've tried to get him to sit--
[barks]
Hmm... Okay, well, then I tried to get him to beg--
[pants]
Spin. Now shake.
[grunts]
Cheerleader split.
Chicken.
[chicken sounds]
Chicken nugget. Air guitar.
[laughs]
Now play dead.
What? You did it. You're a miracle worker.
Well, I don't like to brag,but--
That's great. We've got a problem worm that needs training.
What?
[whistles] Bring him in, fellas!
Say hello to Butcher.
[screams]
[animal sounds]
Heel, heel! Ah, stop--heel, heel--fetch, heel, heel!
Hey, you're not a worm anymore.
Nah, I snapped out of it hours ago. I just wanted Squidward to feel like he did a good job.
All right, that's enough.
I'll teach you!
Yeah, I hope Squidward's not too tough on him.
Will you sit--good dog, sit.
Will you sit? No--don't!
Good afternoon, gentlemen. Nice day for a walk.
