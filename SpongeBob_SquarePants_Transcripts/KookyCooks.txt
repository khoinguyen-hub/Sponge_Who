[The episode begins at Fancy!]
Mrs. Puff: Oh, this restaurant is so fancy! Even the silverware is made of velvet. [feels the fork]
Mr. Krabs: [laughs] Nothing's too good for my Puffykins.
Waiter: Madame and Monsieur, your menus. [hands out menus to Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you. [briefly reads menu] These prices!
Waiter: And what would madame zelle desire?
Mrs. Puff: [giggles] I don't know. What do you think, Krabsy-Wabsy?
Mr. Krabs: The water looks delicious, Puffcake.
Mrs. Puff: [laughs] Such a kidder. Monsiuer and I will have the Kelp Konsuime to start.
Mr. Krabs: Start?
Mrs. Puff: Followed by the Sargasso Salad, and the Sweet and Sour Algae.
Waiter: May I suggest the Coral Jubille for dessert? Its our most expensive item.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, yes! We must try that, Eugene. We'll take two.
Mr. Krabs: Yeah, sure. Of course.
Waiter: Excellent choice, madam.
Mr. Krabs: [moans]
Mr. Krabs' eyestalks: Do something, Krabs! You're gonna go broke!
Mr. Krabs: Hee hee hee. I'll get soup all over me nice suit, and our meal will be free. [rolls small dinner roll onto floor, which the Waiter slips on, but lands safely and catches the soup in the bowl.]
[applause]
Mr. Krabs: I've got one last thing to try. [rapidly places unseen object in bowl and snaps his fingers] Waiter! There's an eyelash in me soup.
Waiter: Oh my dear, how revolting. [he pulls on the eyelash, revealing SpongeBob is in the bowl] Eeew.
Mrs. Puff: [gasps] SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh, bonjour, Mrs. Puff! Mr. Krabs said if I came along, we'd all get a free meal!
Mrs. Puff: [angrily] Eugene! This is so embarassing! [walks away]
Mr. Krabs: Heh, heh! Wait!
Waiter: Wait! Your bill, sir! [he reveals the bill, which is very long in length]
Mr. Krabs: [pulls coupons out of his suit] Do you accept Krusty Krab coupons? [the Waiter kicks him out of the restaurant and sees Mrs. Puff] Oh no, don't go sweetie Puff! Your little Krabsy is so sorry!
Mrs. Puff: Once again, you ruined our whole evening by being cheap! I thought you cared about me!
Mr. Krabs: I do. I'll make it up to you, Honey biscuit. Tommorow night at my house, we'll have the most romantic and fancy type meal you ever tasted!
Mrs. Puff: Alright. But it better be perfect. [boops Krabs' nose] Or else!
SpongeBob: [carrying soup and running] Mr. Krabs, you forgot your soup.
Mr. Krabs: [devours soup] SpongeBob, I've got another little job for you tonight.
French narrator: Zee next evening...
[At Mr. Krabs' house]
SpongeBob: [ringing Mr. Krabs doorbell] I love working free overtime!
Squidward: Like I love the sweet embrace of death.
Mr. Krabs: Get inside you two before Mrs. Puff sees ya! [drags SpongeBob and Squidward into his kitchen] SpongBob, you're cooking a fancy pants dinner for me and Mrs. Puff.
SpongeBob: I came prepared, Mr. Krabs. [he rips off his clothes, revealing a tuxedo and shiny black pants] Fancy pants for a fancy meal.
Squidward: Ha! SpongeBob can't cook anything but grease trap muck! He's not a gourmet like moi!
SpongeBob: Not true! I can cook fancy food! [whispering into Mr. Krabs' ear] I once made a Krabby Patty with three buns!
Mr. Krabs: You make a good point, Squidward. That's why you're gonna use your hyperlutin' knowledge to supervise him.
Squidward: Of course.
Mr. Krabs: [whistles] Pearl! You're serving the food.
Pearl: [walks in] But Daddy, I was planning on staring at my phone tonight! [sighs and attempts putting on fancy dress as SpongeBob, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs walk into the kitchen]
[in the kitchen]
Squidward: This place is ancient! How are we supposed to cook anything with this junk?
Mr. Krabs: What are you talking about? This is high quality Navy surplus here! [he opens his oven, revealing a group of old pirates cooking with a campfire who run out quickly] Heh heh heh. So maybe its a little outdated. Now just get cooking! That dinner better be fantastic or else! [hears doorbell ringing] Ooh! Me lady fair is here! [dashes out of the kitchen to get the door]
SpongeBob: [climbs onto kitchen counter] Ooh! What does this do? [he pulls on the string of a small cannon located on the counter, launching out two pieces of buttered bread that land on Squidward's face]
Squidward: [moans in anger]
Mr. Krabs: [opens the door for Mrs. Puff who walks into his house] Good evening, my dear. May I say you look lovelier than a stack of twenty's.
Mrs. Puff: Oh, Eugene! [Mr. Krabs kisses her arm] You know how I love it when you compare me to folded money!
[in the dining room]
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs takes Mrs. Puff to her seat] Me daughter Pearl will be our server tonight.
Mrs. Puff: [slight gasp] How sweet.
[Mr. Krabs snaps his claws as a signal for Pearl to pour it now.]
[Pearl sighs in irritation.]
[Pearl takes Mr. Krabs's claw and snaps the bottle off with his claws and proceeds to pour it.]
[Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff laughs while Pearl go to the kitchen while continuing to sigh in irritation.]
[Mr. Krabs and Mrs. Puff then drinks.]
[Mrs. Puff gets heart in her eyes, showing her affection for Mr. Krabs.]
Mrs. Puff: [as she burps] Oh, the sparkling sampler is extra fizzy tonight.
Mr. Krabs: Now you just relax, Puffkins, while I consult with my very expensive private chefs. [He walks off to the kitchen nervously.]
Mr. Krabs: Alright, hurry up, you cheap slob slingers! Get the dinner on the table.
[Squidward goes to the fridge and grabs the vegetables]
Squidward: [as he puts the vegetables on the table for SpongeBob to cook.] Here. Even a simpleton like you can make a salad.
